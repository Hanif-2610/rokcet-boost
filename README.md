# 🚀 Rocket Boost - Unity Learning Project

**Rocket Boost** is a beginner-level Unity project where I learn the fundamentals of game development using C# and the Unity engine. The game features a rocket controlled through physics-based mechanics and covers key Unity concepts like input handling, audio, scene management, and visual effects.

## 🎮 Project Overview

In *Rocket Boost*, the player pilots a rocket using thrust and rotation controls to navigate through increasingly complex levels. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Unity’s physics system, scripting workflows, audio systems, and level design.

## 📚 Learning Topics Covered

This project is broken down into multiple sections, each focusing on a specific skill or Unity system:

### 🔧 Development & Programming
- Understanding **Namespaces & Classes**
- Handling **player input** with the Unity Input System
- Applying **physics-based movement** with `AddRelativeForce()`
- Rotating objects based on input
- Writing clean, **refactored** and modular code
- Using **switch statements** and **bools** for state management
- Implementing **Invoke()** to delay events
- Creating **utility scripts** (quit app, oscillation, debug keys)

### 🎥 Visual & Camera Systems
- Setting up **Cinemachine** for dynamic camera following
- Introducing **Post-Processing** effects
- Adding **lights** and improving level aesthetics
- Working with **colliders** and level geometry

### 🔊 Audio & Feedback
- Using **AudioSource** to play SFX
- Triggering multiple audio clips
- Creating **booster sound effects**
- Managing audio feedback for events

### ✨ Particle Systems & Effects
- Creating **particle effects** for boosters and collisions
- Triggering particles on specific game states or inputs

### 🌍 Level Design & Scene Management
- Designing and laying out levels
- Managing **scene transitions** with `SceneManager`
- Implementing a **respawn system**
- Adding **set dressing** and polish to levels
- Prefabbing game objects for reuse
